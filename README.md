# Hestia Libraries (Hugo Static Site Generator)

[![Hestia Libraries](.src/logos/hestia_1200x270.svg)](#)

One Peaceful Frontend+Backend Software Library Suite.

This repository houses libraries specifically designed for Hugo static site
generator codenamed `hestiaHUGO`.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> As the technologies under Holloway managements are expanding, we are
> **NO LONGER** supporting this module development. The library is hosted here
> for archive purposes and also in-case of any emergency needs.
>
> Please use other generator technology like the
> [Holloway's Angular Static Website Builder](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/APP_Website_Angular).




## Why It Matters
This project was initiated primarily because of:

1. **Be done with supply chain threats** caused by geo-political nuisance, dirty
   after the fact shenanigans, or cut-throat charges.
2. **Simple to integrate** with a simple `zip` archive format + its GPG
   cryptography signature for integrity checking.
3. **Deploy everywhere** from servers to microcontrollers where anything that
   can compute.
4. **Inter-operable with other hestia libraries** - save times mingling around
   standards acceptances and easily integrate to existing technologies.
